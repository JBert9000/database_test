I am following one of the tutorials from this course: https://www.udemy.com/the-python-mega-course/

This repo will be to test 2 SQL libraries (SQLite3 and Postgres). I already have some experience with Postgres, but am eager to get a refresher. I am also looking forward to learning more about SQLite3.
